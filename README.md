# CampyGoLucky

Created by Iris Silverman, Brittan Fairchild, and Katana Tran

We wanted to create an app that would let you plan a hiking and camping themed road trip to anywhere in the United States.

Features

A customizable roadtrip, containing campsites that you choose as waypoints
Google Maps with directions
Live 5 day weather forcast via DarkSky API

Instructions

Start by opening the index.html file in a browser, as well as spinning up a rails server.
Firstly, you will input your username into the required field. Next, give a few descriptors to the trip you will create, as well as a starting city.
Once submitted, a map of your starting city will populate. You can search for another city in the upper left to reposition your map to that location. Click on the map to populate campsites around the location you have clicked. Clicking on a campsite will let you select details about that campsite, access a weather forecast, populate nearby hiking trails on the map, and add that campsite to your trip. Once the campsite has been added to your trip, it will populate below the map. Clicking on a hiking trail on the map will allow you to see details about that trail as well as the weather forecast for that area.
Once you have added all the campsites you want to for that trip, you can click on 'My Trips' in the upper left to return to the list of trips you have saved. On this menu, you can edit each of your trips and you can get driving directions from your starting city to each of your chosen campsites and then back to your point of origin.
